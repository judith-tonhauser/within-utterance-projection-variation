This folder contains the material for the paper "Predicting within-utterance projection variation", that is, the investigation of the asymmetry in the projection of BEL and CC in negative "know"-utterances. 

# /results: The data, graphs and analysis scripts for Exp 2 from Scontras & Tonhauser 2025.

# /models: The models reported on in the paper.

0_scontras-tonhauser2025: The model reported on in section 3 of Scontras & Tonhauser 2025, Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung.

1_simplified-know: A simplified variant of the model in 0_scontras-tonhauser2025 (only plausible CGs, no sensitivity to prior beliefs). This is the model discussed in section 3.1-3.3.

2_simplified-know-noisy-QUD-fitted: A variant of 1_simplified-know where there is uncertainty about the QUD and whose parameter values have been fitted to the human data. This is the model discussed in section 3.4.
